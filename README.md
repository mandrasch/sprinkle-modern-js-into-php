Just experimental.

Goal: Compare page weight and developer experience for usage of modern js solutions in PHP templates. I want to sprinkle in interactive components into 'classical' PHP CMSes such as Statamic, typo3, etc.

- `ddev start`
- `ddev launch`

To build the experiments, you need to run

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

in each directory first.

Each directory has it's own README.md
